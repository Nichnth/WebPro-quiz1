            <p class="paragraph">
                East Jakarta (Jakarta Timur) is one of the five administrative cities (kota administrasi) that make up the Special Capital Region of Jakarta, Indonesia. East Jakarta is one of the more populated areas of the city. It has a mix of middle- and working-class residents. Like the rest of Jakarta, East Jakarta is ethnically diverse, with Javanese, Sundanese, Betawi, and Chinese-Indonesian populations, among others.</br></br>

                East Jakarta is well-connected via major roads and highways such as Jalan Raya Bogor and Jalan Raya Bekasi. It also has access to the Jakarta Outer Ring Road (Jalan Tol Lingkar Luar Jakarta). This area is also served by various modes of public transportation, including TransJakarta buses, commuter trains (KRL), and soon, the LRT (Light Rail Transit), which will help improve mobility.
